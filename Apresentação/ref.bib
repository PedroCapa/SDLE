	abstract = {Distributed data aggregation is an important task, allowing the decentralized determination of meaningful global properties, that can then be used to direct the execution of other applications. The resulting values result from the distributed computation of functions like count, sum and average. Some application examples can found to determine the network size, total storage capacity, average load, majorities and many others. In the last decade, many diﬀerent approaches have been proposed, with diﬀerent trade-oﬀs in terms of accuracy, reliability, message and time complexity. Due to the considerable amount and variety of aggregation algorithms, it can be diﬃcult and time consuming to determine which techniques will be more appropriate to use in speciﬁc settings, justifying the existence of a survey to aid in this task. This work reviews the state of the art on distributed data aggregation algorithms, providing three main contributions. First, it formally deﬁnes the concept of aggregation, characterizing the diﬀerent types of aggregation functions. Second, it succinctly describes the main aggregation techniques, organizing them in a taxonomy. Finally, it provides some guidelines toward the selection and use of the most relevant techniques, summarizing their principal characteristics.},
